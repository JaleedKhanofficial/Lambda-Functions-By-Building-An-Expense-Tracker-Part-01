# Step 9
# In this project, you're going to build a simple, yet functional expense tracker in Python.

# Start by defining a function named add_expense that takes three parameters: expenses, amount and category. Use the pass keyword to fill the function body.

def add_expense(expenses, amount, category):            # step 9
    pass                                                # step 9
