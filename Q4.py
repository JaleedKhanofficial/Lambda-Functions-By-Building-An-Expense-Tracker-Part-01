# Step 4
# You can also access a single element to get its value.

# Lists are zero-indexed like strings are. That means that the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1 and so on.

# To access an element you use bracket notation. For example, example_list[1] is accessing the element at index 1, the second element, of example_list.

# Print the first element of my_list.

my_list = [1, 2]

my_list.append(3)
print(my_list[0])           # step 4
